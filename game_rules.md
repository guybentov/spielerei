## How to play
### Turns
In a turn-based manner, each performer may do **one** of these three actions:

1. Propose a musical direction using the suggestion card you currently have
2. Comment on the other performer's suggestion using one of your 3 reactions
3. Return the suggestion card to the bottom of the deck and draw a new one from the top of the deck

### Suggestions
* When suggesting something new, you are expected to play it verbatim
* On subsequent suggestions, however, you are expected to develop this musical idea

### Reactions
* Your 3 reactions should be assigned the following meanings: Yes, No and Maybe
* The musical or gestural nature of the reaction does not have to directly mirror or correlate to these meanings
* The meaning of the reactions should not change throughout the performance
* When reacting, assume that the other performer knows what is the meaning of your reaction, even though that might not be the case

### Game end
The game ends when one of the performers have reached their goal, the wining performer should declare their victory in order for the performance to end

## Deck preparation
### Suggestions deck
* A suggestion is a musical phrase that can be played on the recorder.
* A suggestion can be original material or a quote. 
* A suggestion should contain enough musical information for motivic development over time. 
* Each suggestion should be between 1 to 5 seconds in length. 
* It is advised to prepare a deck with at least 20 options.
* (Optional) If `Spielerei` is performed along with other musical pieces, it is advised to use material from the program.
* Suggestions can be written with traditional music notation, as short text scores or drawn as graphic scores.

### Reactions deck
* A reaction is an expressive, instrumental gesture.
* Reactions should be distinct and easy to differentiate.
* A reaction should be up to 1 second in length.
* It is advised to prepare a deck with at least 10 options.
* Reactions can be written with traditional music notation, as short text scores or drawn as graphic scores.

## Goal setting
* A goal is a description of a scenario that might occur during the performance.
* The description should not be fully detailed, it is advised to focus on either the physical, theatrical or musical aspects of the performance.
* A goal should be written as simply as possible, making it understandable for both performers and audience members.
* A goal should be no longer than a single sentence.
* When coming up with goals, consider how long would it approximately take to reach it, this is especially important in cases where the performance is time limited.

## Optional variations
`Spielerei` supports additional rules and game variations, allowing for a more varied and complex performance if so desired. All of the variations described bellow are combinable unless explicitly stated.

### Instrument swapping
If the following variation is applied, you will have the option to swap instruments with each other under certain circumstances.

* If a your performance partner does not react for 3 turns in a row, you may take your partner's suggestion recorder. 
* If a your performance partner uses the same reaction 3 turns in a row, you may take your partner's reaction recorder. 
* When taking the recorder from your partner, as a result of the two scenarios mentioned above, you may take it from their hands by force if necessary.
* Once you have two recorders of the same type (suggestion/reaction), you may choose any of them in order to perform the desired action. 
* If you are missing a recorder of a certain type (suggestion/reaction) following the aforementioned rules, you may take your original recorder or your partner's original recorder of that type, provided it is not currently in active use.
* Using a different recorder does not expand your musical vocabulary, you should still use your 3 predefined reactions on the reaction recorder, and the currently available suggestion on the suggestion recorder.

### Alerting and extended communication
If the following variation is applied, you will have further means of communication during the performance.

* If you feel that your partner is not following the rules, you may use the whistle-blow effect in order to alert them.
* You may add physical movement to your suggestions, in such a case, please make sure that the movement receives the same motivic treatment as the suggestion.
* If played together with the [Instrument swapping](#instrument-swapping) variation, and your partner's movement makes their recorders out of your reach, you may alert them using a whistle-blow and gesture them to return to a location which will allow you to take their recorder.
* If played with the [Instrument swapping](#instrument-swapping) variation, and you are missing your reaction recorder, you may react vocally with with Yes, No or Maybe. You may choose any language for your reactions as long as you remain consistent throughout the performance.

### Multiple goals
If the following variation is applied, you will have multiple goals to reach during a single performance. 

When playing with this variation, the following changes should be applied to the performance setup:

* Instead of setting a single goal, each performer should draw 5 random goals from the goals deck.
* If performed in front of an audience a score keeping system should be devised, so the audience members could follow the progress.

This variation can be played in one of the following alternatives:

1. A timer should be set at the beginning of the performance and whoever reaches more goals during this time wins.
2. The game is played until one of the performers reaches all of their goals.
